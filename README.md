# News Credibility classifier
This is application classifies a news piece as being credible or not credible. A news piece can be a post on social media or a full text news article. We created two classifiers: one that handles social media news and the other that handles full text news articles.

## A test set
We have provided some data to test the two models in the data folder. You could use those. The <b>articles_test_set.csv</b> is for testing the classifier for full text news articles and the <b>posts_test_set.csv</b> is for testing the classifier for news posts on social media. You can also upload an individual post or news article if you dont want to use a .csv file.
